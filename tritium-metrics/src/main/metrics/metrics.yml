    metrics:
      max:
        type: gauge
        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the maximum number of bytes that can be used by the corresponding pool.
      used:
        type: gauge
        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the number of bytes used by the corresponding pool.
      committed:
        type: gauge
        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the number of bytes that the jvm has committed to use by the corresponding pool.

        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the number of bytes that the jvm initially requested to the os by the corresponding pool.
      usage:
        type: gauge
        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the ratio of the number of bytes used to the maximum number of bytes that can be used by the corresponding pool.
      used-after-gc:
        type: gauge
        tags: [memoryPool]
        docs: Gauge of the number of bytes used after the last garbage collection by the corresponding pool. Note that this metrics is not supported by all implementations.
  tls:
