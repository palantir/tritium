    The `TaggedMetricsScheduledExecutorService` no longer reports the following metrics:

    * `executor.scheduled.once` meter
    * `executor.scheduled.overrun` meter
    * `executor.scheduled.repetitively` counter
    * `executor.scheduled.percent_of_period` histogram

    It was observed that these metrics are not actually being used.
