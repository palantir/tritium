  description: "Remove unnecessary executor metrics. \n\n* `executor.completed` is
    identical to the `count` value of the `executor.duration` timer. Dashboards will
    need to replace the former with the latter.\n* `executor.scheduled.percent-of-period`
    is unused, our pipeline has filtered out the metric for a while now to reduce
    bloat.\n*  Scheduled executors no longer produce `executor.scheduled.once`,
    `executor.scheduled.repetitively`, or `executor.submitted` because they are not
    meaningful when some tasks recur."
