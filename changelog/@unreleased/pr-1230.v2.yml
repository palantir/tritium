  description: "Remove unnecessary executor metrics. \n\n* `executor.completed` is
    identical to the `count` value of the `executor.duration` timer. Dashboards will
    need to replace the former with the latter.\n* `executor.scheduled.percent-of-period`
    is unused, our pipeline has filtered out the metric for a while now to reduce
    bloat.\n* `executor.scheduled.once` and `executor.scheduled.repetitively` have
    been collapsed into `executor.submitted` because they measure the same thing.
    This should allow more existing dashboards to handle scheduled executors without
    updates."
