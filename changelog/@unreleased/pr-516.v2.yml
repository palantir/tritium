    description: |
      The `jvm.attribute.name` and `jvm.attribute.vendor` gauges have been removed as their string values can't be represented in DataDog.
      The information is now provided as tags on the `jvm.attribute.uptime` metric.
- type: improvement
  improvement:
    description: The `jvm.attribute.uptime` metric now has several additional tags corresponding
      to the JVM system properties `java.specification.version`, `java.version`, `java.version.date`,
      `java.runtime.version`, `java.vendor.version`, `java.vm.vendor`, allowing observability
      of how long a particular JVM version has been up for.
