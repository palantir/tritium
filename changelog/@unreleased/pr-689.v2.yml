    When registering a Caffeine cache that does not have stats recording
    enabled, log a warning and increment a "cache.stats.disabled" counter to
    notify consumers of that their caches will not produce expected metrics.

    Unfortunately Guava Caches do not currently expose a mechanism to
    determine this, so this only applies to Caffeine caches (which should
    generally be preferred over Guava caches anyway, see
    <https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline/pull/317>).
