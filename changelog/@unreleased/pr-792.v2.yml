    Socket handshake metrics are not recorded by default to prevent new threads for each handshake

    Metrics and logging can be enabled by either enabling debug logging
    on `com.palantir.tritium.metrics.HandshakeInstrumentation` or
    by setting the `instrument.tls.socket` property to `true`.
