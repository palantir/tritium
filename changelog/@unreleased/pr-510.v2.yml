fix:
  description: Tritium instrumentation handles null InvocationContexts.
    A behavior change was introduced in #379 which resulted in handlers
    which return a null InvocationContext being considered disabled,
    which prevented the onSuccess and onFailure methods from
    being invoked at all.
