    Deduplicate interfaces for byte-buddy instrumentation

    This leads to a sizable performance improvement creating
    instrumented objects in scenarios where interfaces are declared
    multiple times. This is particularly common when dynamic proxies
    are instrumented, as many additional interfaces are discovered.
